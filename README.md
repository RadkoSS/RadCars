üåü Features overview:

Search Functionality: Quickly find car Auctions and Listings based on various criteria such as Car Make, Car Model, City, Engine Type, Description, Title, Total Mileage, Price range etc.
User Profiles: Create listings and auctions, save your favorite listings so you get notified about price changes. You can add Auctions to favorites too! Users can place bids on auctions that have started.
Areas separation: There is an Administrator Area where Admins have full control over all the Auctions and Listings.
Web API: Enhancing the user experience and ensuring that the data presented is always up-to-date.
Real-world Car Data: Seeded to the Database, thanks to https://auto.basebuy.ru/
Real-world Cities Data: The cities of Bulgaria seeded to the Database, thanks to https://simplemaps.com/data/bg-cities

üåü Details about the RadCars application's features: 

Background Jobs scheduling: Auctions are ensured to begin at the desired StartTime and then end at the chosen EndTime thanks to background jobs scheduling. 
Real-Time dynamic refreshing: Real-time refreshing with SignalR for the Auctions ensuring good user experience and instant refresh of pages when a change is being made.
Real-Time Bidding system: Real-Time bids with SignalR for the Auctions, only non-creator Users can bid to an Auction with amounts that meet the rules set by the Creator of the Auction.
Email notifications: Implemented SendGrid for email notifications on new registration and related to the user events in the application - for example, the Creator of the Auction is being notified on Auction End and users are getting notifications when a Listing they had added to their Favorites gets a price decrease by more than 4%.
Responsive design: The application has a responsive design and is working well with different screen sizes.
